# Contributing

Thanks for looking. The most useful contributions here are usually not code: a
control that fires wrongly against a real Bitbucket instance, or remediation
text that does not match what the UI actually says, is worth more than a
refactor.

This document is how the work is done *here*. What a verdict, a `metadata.json`
and a score are *required* to mean is specified once for the whole family, in
[scm-bench](https://github.com/scm-bench/scm-bench/blob/main/docs/bench-contract.md).
The two agree; where a change would make them disagree, the specification is the
one that has to move first, because the other benches read it too.

## Getting set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scm-bench/bitbucket-bench
cd bitbucket-bench

make check      # gofmt, vet, race-enabled tests, Rego compile + policy tests
make policy     # just the Rego: compile, unit tests, coverage
make build      # binary into bin/
make vuln       # govulncheck against what this code actually reaches
make snapshot   # full release build locally, without publishing
```

Go 1.25+; `go.mod` pins a patched toolchain, which Go fetches on its own.
[`opa`](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#running-opa) is needed for
the policy half of `make check`. Nothing else — the bundle is embedded and there
is no code generation step.

No instance to test against? Everything except the fetcher runs offline:

```bash
./bin/bitbucket-bench scan --snapshot-in examples/snapshot.json
```

## The one rule that matters

**A control that cannot be evaluated reports `MANUAL`, never `PASS` or `FAIL`.**

If the token lacks a permission, if an add-on is not installed, if the API never
returned the field — the answer is "I could not tell", and the control leaves
the score. A confident wrong answer is the worst thing this tool can do, because
it teaches people to ignore its output. The rest of the design follows: the
fetcher records what it could not read in `Available` and never substitutes a
zero for missing data, and policies check availability *before* they check the
setting.

## How the pieces fit

```
internal/
  scm/                  normalized snapshot types (the fetcher/policy contract)
    bitbucketdc/        REST client, fetcher, ref-matcher resolution
  checks/policies/      one directory per control: check.rego, check_test.rego,
                        metadata.json
  engine/               compiles the bundle once, evaluates, scores
  report/               table, json, sarif
  diff/                 compares two evaluations; backs `bitbucket-bench diff`
  config/               thresholds handed to Rego as input.config
  cli/                  flags, exit codes, the scan trace
  console/              the table renderer both reports draw with, plus the
                        tagged lines the tool writes about itself on stderr
```

Glob semantics, Bitbucket's branch model and group expansion are resolved in Go
rather than Rego. They are fiddly, version-dependent, and are not policy. The
fetcher hands Rego a boolean: a rule asks *"is the default branch protected?"*,
not *"does `release/**` match `refs/heads/main`?"*

## Adding a control

Create a directory under `internal/checks/policies/bitbucketdc/`. No Go changes
— the bundle is embedded and discovered at load time. Three files:

**`check.rego`** returns a single `result` document.

```rego
package scmbench.rules.cis_1_1_4

import rego.v1
import data.scmbench.lib

result := {"status": "MANUAL", "details": "Merge checks could not be read."} if {
	not lib.available("pullRequestSettings")
} else := {"status": "PASS", "details": "Approvals are dismissed on update."} if {
	lib.pr_setting("unapproveOnUpdate", false) == true
} else := {
	"status": "FAIL",
	"details": "Approvals survive updates, so unreviewed code can be merged.",
	"evidence": ["unapproveOnUpdate = false"],
}
```

The `MANUAL` branch comes first on purpose: deciding what the data says is only
sound once you have established that you have the data.

**Read every list through `lib.list`**, never `object.get`. A nil Go slice
marshals to JSON `null`, and `object.get` only substitutes its default for an
*absent* key — a key present with a null value comes back null, and passing that
to `concat` or `sort` makes the rule undefined, so the control reports nothing
at all. `TestZeroValuedSnapshotProducesAVerdictForEveryControl` guards this.

**`check_test.rego`** is not optional. Every PASS, FAIL and MANUAL branch is
covered and CI holds the bundle at 100% — an uncovered branch is a verdict
nobody has ever seen the rule produce. Run them with `make policy`.

**`metadata.json`** carries the ID, severity, scope and remediation, all in
English: the tool has one output language, so there is nothing to translate.
Remediation is written twice, at two lengths:

- `remediation` — the full paragraph: the settings path, the project-level
  variant covering every repository at once, the exemptions worth granting, and
  the config key that changes what the control counts.
- `fixSummary` — the first move in one imperative line, under 100 characters:
  `Enable "Prevent deletion" at Repository settings -> Branch permissions.`
  This is what each finding's table cell prints, so it must stand alone.

Both must name a concrete place — a settings path, a file to add, or an explicit
statement that nothing applies. `TestRemediationSaysWhereToAct` enforces it.
Vague remediation is worse than none: it wastes the reader's time before they
discover it does not help.

The full field list is the family's, not this repository's: it is specified in
[the bench contract](https://github.com/scm-bench/scm-bench/blob/main/docs/bench-contract.md#5-metadatajson),
with a JSON Schema at
[`schemas/metadata.schema.json`](https://github.com/scm-bench/scm-bench/blob/main/schemas/metadata.schema.json)
you can validate a new file against before opening a pull request. `Load` in
`internal/checks/registry.go` enforces the same rules at startup.

Then add the control to the coverage table in both READMEs.

## Testing

Two suites, because the project is written in two languages and `go test -cover`
cannot see Rego. Go covers the fetcher, engine, reporters and CLI; Rego covers
the controls, held at 100%.

The Go suite runs every control against hardened, misconfigured, unreadable and
zero-valued fixtures, asserting each produces a verdict in every case. Add your
control's expected status to each. **The zero-valued case is not optional** — it
catches the bug where a rule silently produces no verdict, which looks exactly
like a passing test run.

The fetcher is tested against a stand-in Bitbucket covering pagination, renamed
endpoints, permission denials, and the cross-version shapes where a merge check
is a number in one release and an object in another. That proves the code is
self-consistent; it does **not** prove Bitbucket behaves like the stand-in. If
you have a real instance, running against it and reporting what differed is the
single most valuable thing you can do here.

## Releasing

Push a tag, or run the **Release** workflow from the Actions tab and give it the
tag to create. The workflow does the rest.

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "bitbucket-bench v0.1.0" && git push origin v0.1.0
```

Three things that have each gone wrong once:

- **All three components, and the `v`** — `v0.1.0`, never `v0.1`. Go accepts
  `v0.1` as a semver string but not a canonical one, so the module system
  ignores the tag and `go install ...@latest` will not find it. goreleaser
  builds it happily and produces artifacts nobody can install.
- **Publish the draft goreleaser made.** Never start a new release from the
  Releases page: it gets the notes and none of the files, which is how
  `v0.1.0-rc.1` ended up existing twice, once with nothing to download.
- **Use `-rc.N` while something is unverified.** Go's `@latest` resolves to the
  newest *release* version, so a prerelease reaches only those who ask for it by
  name, and you can iterate without spending `v0.1.0`.

Notes are written by hand in the draft; goreleaser fills in the parts carrying a
version number. Signing needs nothing from you — cosign works keylessly from the
workflow's OIDC token. Before publishing, check `checksums.txt.bundle` and the
SBOMs are attached: a release whose signing step was skipped looks complete
otherwise.

## Pull requests

- One change per pull request.
- **Label it.** Release notes are grouped by label and an unlabelled pull
  request lands under "Other changes". The labels are in
  [`.github/labels.json`](.github/labels.json); the mapping to release note
  sections is in [`.github/release.yml`](.github/release.yml).
- Explain what you verified, and say plainly what you could not.

Commit messages take a Conventional Commits prefix — `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`,
`test:`, `build:`, with `!` for a breaking change — and a body explaining *why*
the change is right. The diff shows what it does; the body is for the reasoning,
what was tried and rejected, and what is still not covered.

## Reporting a problem

- **A control is wrong** — tell us the platform version, what the setting
  actually is, and what the tool said. A redacted `--snapshot-out` file is
  ideal.
- **A security issue** — do not open an issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
